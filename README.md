Learning, demos, and experiments with Rust

## About Me
Hi, my name is [Mackenly Jones](https://mackenly.com) and I'm a full stack software engineer. My background is in web oriented languages (JS, TS, PHP), Java, Python, and C# but I am looking to expand my knowledge and experience with Rust. I'm open sourcing this repository to share my learning journey with others and to help others learn Rust as well. If you're looking to learn a new programming language, I suggest that you don't copy and paste code from this repository or get AI to write it for you. Instead, try to understand the code and write it yourself. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me on [Twitter (X)](https://twitter.com/mackenlyjones) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mackenly/).
