Asks a few questions about a password's rules, then generates every possible password that fits those rules. Useful for dictionary attacks.

- Might do something with sorting the most likely passwords.
- Might also create common hashes like MD5, SHA1, SHA256, etc. for each password.
- Might include a search function to search for a specific password based on the hash.
