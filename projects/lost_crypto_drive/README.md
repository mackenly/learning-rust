# lost_crypto_drive
A unique approach to a common learning project. 

We've all heard it before, "If I only knew where I put that hard drive! I had to have had hundreds of bitcoins on it!" Well, now you can see how much you allegedly lost with this tool, which shows how much an investment five years ago would be worth today.

Users are prompted to enter a value in USD that they invested in crypto five years ago. The program then calculates the value of that investment today in Bitcoin and Ethereum. Combining the over done "crypto price project" with a calculator I wanted this project to not just reinvent the wheel, but to make it a little more fun.
